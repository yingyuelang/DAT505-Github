# DAT505-Github XIERUOBING's work

## Section1  

    There are three projects in this section, two of them are the examples which shows how to rotate the geometry and how to change the geometry's position.They are 01test and 04 test.

## Section2

    There is just one project in this section. This peoject called homework2 is my second homework.In this project, i use the geometry to constitute a pattern.

## Section3

    There are three projects including an examples and two works.
    The example called 00_BasicStructure-GUI  shows how to make a box which can be controled in the website.

    One of the work called 01 test i did it on the class and in this peoject, it can control the cubes position, rotation and scale.

    The other work I did called homework3 is the third homework and it shows how i use
    different geometry to constitute a big pattern.

      the s5 arraymesh is a project which can make cubes look like a wave.

## Section6

    the project called s6-01-CityScape-full shows how to build a random scene.

## Section7

    There are 2 projectss in this section.
    The one called s7-01-Texture-Cube shows some cube fall down with different texture.

## Section8

    There are three projects in this section.
    The S8-00-Texture-Eyes-interaction2x shows how to change the 3d coordinate to 2d coordinate and make the five eyes look at one point.

    The S8-01-RaycastSprite shows how to change the cube's color when the mouse on the cube but not click it and. Also, when i click the cube, i can know the cube's position in the console.

## Section9

    There are two projeccts in it.
    the S9-01-RaycastAudio shows i can change the bachground music when i click the object in the scene.
    the work2 is a project which show how to use different effects in the website.
