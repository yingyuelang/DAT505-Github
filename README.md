##Section1  

    There are three projects in this section, two of them are the examples which shows how to rotate the geometry and how to change the geometry's position.They are 01test and 04 test.

    The other one project called homework1 is my first homework and shows my mastery of the knowledge about using geometry in three.js

##Section2
    There is just one project in this section. This peoject called homework2 is my second homework.In this project, i use the geometry to constitute a pattern.
##Section3
    There are three projects including an examples and two works.
    The example called 00_BasicStructure-GUI  shows how to make a box which can be controled in the website.
    One of the work called 01 test i did it on the class and in this peoject, it can control the cubes position, rotation and scale.
    The other work I did called homework3 is the third homework and it shows how i use
    different geometry to constitute a big pattern.
##Section4
    There are two projects in this section.
    They are all the pratice in the class.
##Section5
    There is a projects which i finished in class.
      the s5 arraymesh is a project which can make cubes look like a wave.
##Section6
    the project called s6-01-CityScape-full shows how to build a random scene.
##Section7
    There are 2 projectss in this section.
    The one called s7-01-Texture-Cube shows some cube fall down with different texture.
    The other one called S7-03-Texture-Eyes-Interaction shows some eyes appeared in random place and can rotate follow the mouse position.
##Section8
    There are three projects in this section.
    The S8-00-Texture-Eyes-interaction2x shows how to change the 3d coordinate to 2d coordinate and make the five eyes look at one point.
    The S8-01-RaycastSprite shows how to change the cube's color when the mouse on the cube but not click it and. Also, when i click the cube, i can know the cube's position in the console.
    The S8-02-objLoader-Raycasting shows how to load the obj in the website and change there color when the mouse click it.
##Section9
    There are only on projecct in it.
    the S9-01-RaycastAudio shows i can change the bachground music when i click the object in the scene.
