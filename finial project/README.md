## The content of the finial project
  the project is a interactive picture book. It tells a story about a crane how to help a kind couple which saved it before. It is a tales of Asian that i listened in my childhood.

  In this project, peope can read a story easily by it's picture. There are 6 scene in this project so that when you use this project you may find it is also like real book. Of course, these is a big difference between this project and real book is that there are some simple lines appear if your mouse move on the character. i believe these will help people more easier to read this book. Especially for children.

  there is a picture which show the part about interactive.
